## What's This?

This page outlines how I handle any data that might touch my sites or apps. As a quick, friendly FAQ rather than legal gobbledygook.

## 1. Introduction

I aim to keep your digital footprint as tiny as possible. You can browse, read, or interact without worrying that I'm hoarding personal details.

Short version: I don't collect personal identifiable information (PII) on my own.

## 2. Data Collection

**Myself**: aside from the unavoidable technical logs that any web server generates (like a request timestamp), I store no cookies, analytics, or user identifiers. I collect literally nothing about you.

**Cloudflare**: I use Cloudflare for DNS. They may log basic request metadata (IP address, user‑agent, timestamps) purely to provide those services and protect against abuse. You can review their full policy [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## 3. What This Means For You

You can explore my content knowing that I'm not tracking you across the internet, nor am I building a profile to sell to advertisers. The only footprints that exist are the generic, service‑level logs handled by Cloudflare, which are "standard" for any modern web service.

## 4. Changes

I'll keep this document up to date. Any future change that introduces data collection will be clearly described here.

## 5. Questions

Got a question or something still feels fuzzy? Drop a line through the contact info on my site and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
