    <h2 class="mb-2 text-base font-bold text-[#888888]">What's This?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      This page outlines how I handle any data that might touch my sites or
      apps. Think of it as a quick, friendly FAQ rather than legal gobbledygook.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-2 text-base font-bold text-[#888888]">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I aim to keep your digital footprint as tiny as possible. You can browse,
      read, or interact without worrying that I'm hoarding personal details.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      short version: I don't collect personal identifiable information (PII) on
      my own.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-2 text-base font-bold text-[#888888]">2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Myself</strong>: aside from the unavoidable technical logs that
      any web server generates (like a request timestamp), I store no cookies,
      analytics, or user identifiers. Currently I collect literally nothing
      about you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Cloudflare</strong>: I use Cloudflare for security, DNS, Workers,
      and CDN. They may log basic request metadata (IP address, user‑agent,
      timestamps) purely to provide those services and protect against abuse.
      You can review their full policy <a
        href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"
        class="underline">here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If I ever launch a new feature that requires additional information (e.g.,
      optional user accounts, personalized settings), I will only ask for the
      minimum data needed to make that feature work and will update this page
      before any collection begins.

      3. What This Means For You
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You can explore my content knowing that I'm not tracking you across the
      internet, nor am I building a profile to sell to advertisers. The only
      footprints that exist are the generic, service‑level logs handled by
      Cloudflare, which are standard for any modern web service.

    <p class="mb-4">
      I'll keep this document up to date. Any future change that introduces data
      collection will be clearly described here.

      Got a question or something still feels fuzzy? Drop a line through the
      contact info on my site and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
